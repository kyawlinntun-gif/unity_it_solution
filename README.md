# Shopping Cart Simple Project

    In this project, I use following language:
        1. Laravel, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Axios and Fetch
    
    There are two main parts:
        1. Admin
        2. Customers

    1. Admin
        Admin can make:
            1. Manage Profile
            2. Manage Customer (Delete and Export customers with excel)
            3. Add Item (CRUD and Export items with excel)
            4. Order Lists (Show order lists with order customers and items and Export order lists with excel)

    2. Customers
        Customers can make:
            1. Manage Profile
            2. Add Item to Cart Lists (Add, Remove, Paid with total amount, and Export their cart Lists)
    
    If I have enough time,
        I will add the following process:

        1. Admin
            1. Manage Password and Email Verification
            2. Manage Order Lists (For example If customers cancel items)
            3. other real world features

        2. Customers
            1. Update Password
            2. Manage Order Lists (For example, customers cancel items before cash)
            3. Customer can comment each of the items
            4. Customer can connect to Admin with email
